# Chaos-Theory

Chaos theory is the study of how patterns emerge from randomness and chaos. 

This program models the Chaos Game.

Given three vertices, the program randomly choses one of them and goes halfway to it from its current position. When iterated, it creates a fractal-like shape, also known as, Sierpinksiâ€™s triangle. 

Other variations of this have been programmed by changing the angle of rotation. For example, after the point moves halfway between the current location and the vertex, it also rotates 180 degrees around the selected vertex.
